# filesearch
A simple text search and replace routine for Python3  

Drop it in the folder you want and type

python3 searchtext replacetext

It will go through the text files in your folders (recursively) and replace the searchtext with replacetext, ideal if you change servers and need to update your code.

Backup your data first before running this software.

Enjoy!
